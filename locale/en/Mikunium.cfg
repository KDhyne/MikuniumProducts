[technology-description]
uranium-mining=Allows you to use [fluid=sulfuric-acid] in [entity=electric-mining-drill] to mine [entity=uranium-ore]
uranium-processing=Mikunium ore is processed in centrifuges into Mikunium-309, with a chance to result in a richer Mikunium-CV01. Both are needed to create Mikunium fuel cells.
nuclear-power=Powerful and sophisticated method of power generation using Mikunium fuel cells.
kovarex-enrichment-process=The process to create Mikunium-CV01 from Mikunium-309. It requires a large amount of Mikunium-CV01 as a catalyst.
nuclear-fuel-reprocessing=The process of reprocessing used Mikunium fuel cells to create Mikunium-309.
uranium-ammo=Advanced ammunition from Mikunium-309 for higher hardness and weight, resulting in massive damage.
atomic-bomb=Devastating form of rockets used to eradicate anything in huge areas at a time.\n\nLove is War
